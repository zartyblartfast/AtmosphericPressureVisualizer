  <p>The Atmospheric Pressure Visualizer is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Here are some simple steps to get you started:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Input your parameters:</strong> Use the sliders or input fields to set the Pressure at Sea Level, Standard and Altitude. These values will be used to calculate the atmospheric pressure.</li>
    <li><strong>View the output:</strong> The calculated pressure will be displayed in the Output section. This value represents the estimated atmospheric pressure at the given altitude. You can also see the black circle marker on the chart's horizontal axis (Altitude Km) get visual feedback as to the Altitude you have entered relative to the Air Pressure line.</li>
    <li><strong>Explore the visualization:</strong> The chart provides a visual representation of the relationship between altitude and atmospheric pressure. As you adjust the input parameters, the chart will update to reflect these changes.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Remember, the Atmospheric Pressure Visualizer is a tool for estimation and visualization. While it is based on established scientific models, it should not be used for precise calculations where exact accuracy is required.</p>
