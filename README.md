## Atmospheric Pressure Calculator

The Atmospheric Pressure Calculator is a web application that allows users to visualize and calculate atmospheric pressure at different altitudes. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting atmospheric variables and generates a visual representation of the atmosphere as a vertical column, along with corresponding pressure values.

## Features

- Calculate atmospheric pressure at a given altitude using the barometric formula.
- Visualize the atmosphere as a vertical column with markers indicating altitude and pressure.
- Interactive form with input fields for atmospheric variables.
- Default values provided for easy initialization.
- Dynamic chart showcasing the relationship between altitude and atmospheric pressure.
- Responsive design for seamless usage across different devices.

## How to Use

1. Access the Atmospheric Pressure Calculator web page.
2. Input the desired atmospheric variables:
   - **P₀**: Atmospheric pressure at sea level (in hPa).
   - **L**: Temperature lapse rate (in °C per kilometer).
   - **h**: Altitude above sea level (in kilometers).
   - **T₀**: Standard temperature at sea level (in Kelvin).
3. The web application will calculate the atmospheric pressure at the given altitude and update the visual representation.
4. The calculated pressure value will be displayed next to the altitude marker.
5. Additionally, a dynamic chart will showcase the relationship between altitude and atmospheric pressure.
6. Explore different inputs to observe the variations in atmospheric pressure.
